# Computational Intelligence 2022/2023

This repo contains all the materials for the 2022/2023 edition of the [Computational Intelligence course](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01URROV&p_a_acc=2022&p_header=S&p_lang=IT&multi=N) @ [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it)

This repo will be hosting code bites for the assigned projects and labs, alongside with brief descriptions (in general, whatever I used to prepare for the final) ü§ñüç∫

**Update**

I passed the course *cum laude* (scoring 38/38, props to me I'd say). 

A complete overview of the labs can be found in this repo. My final project on solving the game of Quarto with Deep Reinforcement Learning can be found [here](https://github.com/fracapuano/Quinto). 
Make sure to cite my work if you do use it and star the repo. 
If you wish to contribute to the project of Quinto (we mainly need other agents we could use for training our own agent), please consider opening a pull request.
